This repository contains all the tasks done by me during my Internship with The Sparks Foundation.

# Task 1 Improve your LinkedIn Profile

# Task 2 To Explore Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of
marks that a student is expected to score based upon the
number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear
regression task as it involves just two variables.
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

# Task 3 To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning 
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of
clusters and represent it visually.

# Task 4 To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and
visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
